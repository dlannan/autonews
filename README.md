This is a simple Defold project to get some experience using it for application development. The long term goal is to integrate it into my online simulation system.

The general idea is that this application will trawl and categorize information from the internet generating links that allow the user to visit. A simple example:
A user wants recent tech news. 
The user provides a list of 'preferred' urls (they get a higher priority) and the app also does 'regular' searches as well, then it ranks and builds a list suited to the user. As time goes by, the user effectively trains the algorithm to better select sources of this news.

This will not be an amazing app. its a test for using Defold in a way it probably wasnt initially intended for ;)
And it will help trial interfaces and controls that will allow me to devleop applications that can work with already built systems.
